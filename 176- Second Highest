/*
LeetCode Problem: 176. Second Highest Salary
Difficulty: Medium
Topic: SQL (Subquery, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET)

Problem:
Find the second highest DISTINCT salary from the Employee table.
If there is no second highest salary, return NULL.

Approach:
1. Use DISTINCT to remove duplicate salaries.
2. Sort salaries in descending order.
3. Skip the highest salary using OFFSET 1.
4. Use LIMIT 1 to get only the second highest salary.
5. Wrap inside a subquery to return NULL if it does not exist.

SELECT (
    SELECT DISTINCT salary
    FROM Employee
    ORDER BY salary DESC
    LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1
) AS SecondHighestSalary;
