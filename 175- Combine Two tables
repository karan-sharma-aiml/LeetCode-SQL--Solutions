/*
LeetCode Problem: 175. Combine Two Tables
Difficulty: Easy
Topic: SQL (LEFT JOIN)

Problem:
Report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person.
If the address of a person is not present in the Address table,
report NULL instead.

Approach:
1. Use LEFT JOIN to keep all records from the Person table.
2. Match rows using personId.
3. If no matching address exists, city and state will return NULL.

SELECT p.firstName,
       p.lastName,
       a.city,
       a.state
FROM Person p
LEFT JOIN Address a
ON p.personId = a.personId;
